        ========================PASS========================


        TEST #2: Test Adjacencies

        ========================PASS========================


        TEST #3: Simple Shortest Path

        ========================PASS========================


        TEST #4: Less Simple Shortest Path

        ========================PASS========================


        TEST #5: Shortest Path between a single point

        ========================PASS========================


        TEST #6: Shortest Path on Map 2

        TEST #7: Shortest Path on Map 2

        ========================PASS========================


        TEST #8: No Path

        ========================PASS========================


        TEST #9: Distance from a single city (should be 0)

        ========================PASS========================


        TEST #10: Distance between two cities
